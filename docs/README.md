# Internal documentation

Developer-facing docs for contributors and maintainers of
`@drarzter/kafka-client` — a type-safe Kafka wrapper for NestJS built on
`@confluentinc/kafka-javascript`. This set explains **what lives where and what
is responsible for what**: the layering, data flow, invariants, and design
decisions behind the code. It complements — and deliberately does not duplicate —
the two other top-level docs:

- **`README.md`** (repo root) — user-facing API reference and usage examples.
  When these docs say "see the public API", that's where to look.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (repo root) — agent instructions, the source-tree map, and the
  running list of constraints & gotchas.

The source is the ultimate authority; every factual claim here is meant to be
verifiable against a concrete file.

## Contents

| Doc | What it covers |
|-----|----------------|
| [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) | The big picture: the five layers (facade → context bag → impl modules → transport interface → transport impls), the orthogonal security/outbox/config leaf modules, why the context-object pattern is used, entry-point/export map, dependency rules, and the core design tenets. |
| [`module-map.md`](./module-map.md) | Every source file with a one-line responsibility, grouped by directory (client, transport, message, security, outbox, config, cli, chaos, bench, nest, testing), plus the file-naming convention (`name.role.ts`). |
| [`producer.md`](./producer.md) | The send pipeline: `preparePayload`, automatic envelope headers, typed-key resolution, delayed delivery (`deliverAfterMs` → `<topic>.delayed`), the Lamport clock lifecycle, transactions (`_txChain`, tx-id registry, fencing, connect idempotency), the lag throttle, and tombstones. |
| [`consumer.md`](./consumer.md) | The consumer flavours (incl. the delayed-delivery relay) and how they map onto the two core pipelines; the per-message stages in order; circuit-breaker wiring; `DedupStore`-backed deduplication (fail-open); lazy producer connect for routing consumers; `consume()` backpressure; and per-flavour semantic caveats. |
| [`retry-and-dlq.md`](./retry-and-dlq.md) | In-process retry vs the durable retry-topic chain (companion consumers, EOS routing transactions, `x-retry-*` headers), DLQ headers/naming, `replayDlq` mechanics (and its `.dlq` guard), and what does **not** propagate into the retry chain. |
| [`nestjs.md`](./nestjs.md) | The NestJS layer: `KafkaModule.register`/`registerAsync`, the forwarded option subset (incl. `security`), multi-client tokens, the `KafkaExplorer` discovery flow + double-registration guard, `@SubscribeTo`, the health indicator, and the esbuild/`design:paramtypes` constraint. |
| [`testing.md`](./testing.md) | The three test doubles (Jest manual mock, `FakeTransport`, `createMockKafkaClient`), `FakeTransport`'s fidelity divergences, `KafkaTestContainer`/integration setup (incl. Redis-dedup / Postgres-outbox reference specs and the testcontainers-12 readiness retry), the chaos suite, `containers:clean`, and how `handle.ready()` keeps tests deterministic. |
| [`configuration.md`](./configuration.md) | The complete configuration reference: the three layers (defaults → env → code) and their precedence, full tables mapping every `KafkaClientOptions` / `ConsumerOptions` field to its env var (or "code only"), the `fromEnv` helpers, security/cloud-IAM rules, NestJS `ConfigService` vs `fromEnv`, and a "where do I configure X" decision table. |

## Where do I look for X?

| I want to understand… | Start here |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| How a `KafkaClient` method reaches its logic | [architecture.md](./architecture.md#the-context-object-pattern) — facade delegates to `fn(ctx, ...)` |
| Where a specific file's responsibility is | [module-map.md](./module-map.md) |
| What headers a message gets on send | [producer.md](./producer.md#automatic-envelope-headers) |
